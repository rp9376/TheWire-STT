You are given a full transcript of a news broadcast from The Wire. Your task is to extract and summarize information into a structured JSON object. Follow these instructions carefully:

Output: A JSON object only. Do not include any text before or after.

The JSON must contain the following top-level structure:
{
  "broadcast_metadata": {
    "date": "",
    "time": "",
    "precedence": "",
    "information_cutoff": ""
  },
  "stories": [
    {
      "metadata": {
        "topic": "",
        "title": "",
        "tldr": "",
        "date": "",
        "time": ""
      },
      "text": ""
    }
    // (3 more stories, formatted identically)
  ]
}

Instructions:

1. Extract the following values from the standard broadcast header (usually found at the beginning of the transcript), which may look like this:

   "This is The Wire for 2300 Zulu, June 16, 2025. Precedence is routine. Information cutoff is 2200. Bottom line up front."

   Use this to fill the "broadcast_metadata" section:
   - "date": the broadcast date (format: DD/MM/YYYY)
   - "time": the broadcast time in Zulu (24-hour GMT format, e.g., "23:00 (GMT)")
   - "precedence": the urgency level (e.g., routine, priority, immediate)
   - "information_cutoff": latest included info time in Zulu (e.g., "22:00 (GMT)")

2. Under the "stories" key, include exactly four stories from the transcript. Each must include:
   - "metadata":
     - "topic": subject or theme of the story
     - "title": a clear, concise headline
     - "tldr": a one-sentence summary
     - "date": date of the story (same as broadcast)
     - "time": time of the story (time of the broadcast if not specified)

3. Analyst commentary may appear in the transcript. If so, integrate key insights into the relevant storyâ€™s text, but clearly distinguish analysis from reported facts. Do not treat analyst commentary as a separate story.

Formatting rules:
- Use double quotes for all keys and string values
- Indent all nested structures with two spaces
- Separate items in the "stories" array with a comma followed by a newline
- Do not include trailing commas or extra whitespace
